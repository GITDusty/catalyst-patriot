# Codebase Concerns

**Analysis Date:** 2026-02-05

## Project Maturity Issues

**Boilerplate Stage:**
- Issue: Application is in early stage of development with minimal implementation
- Files: `app/page.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`
- Impact: No business logic, no data handling, no API endpoints implemented
- Context: Project appears freshly generated from `create-next-app` scaffold

## Missing Critical Features

**No Test Infrastructure:**
- Problem: No testing framework configured or tests written
- Files: Entire project (`app/` directory)
- What's missing: No Jest, Vitest, or other test runner configured; no unit, integration, or E2E tests
- Risk: Code changes cannot be validated automatically; no regression detection
- Priority: High - Should be addressed before feature development begins

**No Error Boundary Implementation:**
- Problem: No error boundaries or custom error pages for runtime errors
- Files: `app/` directory lacks `error.tsx` or similar error handling components
- Current behavior: Runtime errors will fall back to Next.js default error handling
- Recommendation: Add `app/error.tsx` for client-side errors and `app/global-error.tsx` for server-side errors

**No Logging System:**
- Problem: No centralized logging framework configured
- Files: Application-wide (none currently in use)
- Impact: Difficult to debug issues in production; no observability infrastructure
- Current: Only console API available for debugging
- Recommendation: Add logging library (e.g., Pino, Winston) as project scales

**No Environment Configuration:**
- Problem: No `.env.local` or environment variable setup documented
- Files: `.env*` files missing
- Impact: Application cannot be configured for different deployment environments
- Recommendation: Create `.env.example` documenting required variables before adding features

## Security Considerations

**Missing Security Headers:**
- Risk: Application lacks security headers like CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- Files: `next.config.ts` - empty, no headers middleware
- Current mitigation: None
- Recommendations:
  - Add security headers via `next.config.ts` headers configuration
  - Consider adding `next-safe` or similar package for security headers
  - Document CORS policy before adding API endpoints

**No Input Validation:**
- Risk: Any future form inputs or API endpoints will lack validation
- Files: Application-wide; no schema validation library configured
- Current state: TypeScript types only (compile-time, not runtime)
- Recommendation: Add Zod, Joi, or similar for runtime schema validation

**No Authentication Mechanism:**
- Risk: Currently no auth system, but will be needed for user-specific features
- Files: None currently (not applicable to boilerplate)
- Planning concern: Need to evaluate auth strategy before user data is handled
- Options: NextAuth.js, Auth0, Supabase Auth, custom JWT

## Code Quality & Maintainability Issues

**Boilerplate Metadata Not Updated:**
- Issue: Hardcoded default Next.js metadata in `app/layout.tsx`
- Files: `app/layout.tsx` (lines 15-18)
- Current:
  ```typescript
  export const metadata: Metadata = {
    title: "Create Next App",
    description: "Generated by create next app",
  };
  ```
- Impact: SEO metadata does not reflect actual application purpose
- Fix approach: Replace with actual project metadata and add dynamic metadata for pages

**Unused Default Fonts:**
- Issue: Geist fonts are imported but may not be necessary
- Files: `app/layout.tsx` (lines 5-13)
- Impact: Adds unnecessary font loading overhead if not used in design
- Recommendation: Verify if custom fonts are actually needed; remove if unused

**Empty Next.js Configuration:**
- Issue: `next.config.ts` contains only comments and defaults
- Files: `next.config.ts`
- Impact: Makes future configuration harder; no clear pattern for adding settings
- Recommendation: Document configuration strategy early; comment why each setting was chosen

**Incomplete CSS Font Declaration:**
- Issue: `globals.css` declares font-family as "Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" (line 25)
- Files: `app/globals.css` (line 25)
- Current: Not using declared Geist fonts from `next/font/google`
- Impact: CSS font stack doesn't match React font imports
- Fix approach: Use CSS custom properties: `font-family: var(--font-sans);`

## Missing DevOps & Deployment

**No Build Verification:**
- Problem: No pre-commit hooks or build verification in pipeline
- Impact: Broken builds can be committed; no linting enforcement
- Recommendation: Add Husky + lint-staged for pre-commit checks

**Missing Documentation:**
- Problem: README.md is default boilerplate from `create-next-app`
- Files: `README.md`
- Impact: No project-specific setup instructions, architecture, or contribution guidelines
- Recommendation: Update README with actual project purpose, setup steps, and development workflow

**No .gitignore File:**
- Problem: `.gitignore` file not found
- Files: Root directory
- Risk: Environment files, build artifacts, or IDE files could be accidentally committed
- Recommendation: Create `.gitignore` covering:
  - `.env.local`, `.env.*.local`
  - `.next/`, `out/`, `build/`
  - `node_modules/`
  - IDE-specific files (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`)
  - OS files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`)

**No CI/CD Pipeline:**
- Problem: No GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or other CI/CD configured
- Impact: Cannot automate testing, linting, or deployment
- Recommendation: Set up CI/CD pipeline to run:
  - `npm run lint` on all PRs
  - Tests (once added)
  - Build verification

## Performance Considerations

**No Image Optimization Strategy:**
- Problem: No `next/image` usage documented or configured
- Files: Application-wide
- Impact: Any images added will not benefit from automatic optimization
- Recommendation: Establish convention for using `next/image` for all dynamic images

**Font Loading Not Optimized:**
- Issue: Geist fonts loaded but not confirmed to be used
- Files: `app/layout.tsx` (Google Fonts integration)
- Current: Fonts imported but CSS doesn't reference them correctly
- Impact: Potential font loading waterfall blocking page render
- Fix: Ensure CSS properly applies font variables; verify preloading strategy

**No Caching Strategy:**
- Problem: No HTTP caching headers or revalidation strategy defined
- Files: `next.config.ts`
- Impact: All responses served fresh on every request
- Recommendation: Implement ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) or cache headers as features are added

## Scaling Readiness

**Single-Page Application:**
- Current capacity: Handles simple static pages only
- Limit: Will need routing structure expansion for multi-page apps
- Scaling path: Add nested routes following `app/` directory conventions; structure by feature

**No Database Integration:**
- Current state: No database configured or connected
- Blocks: User data, content management, dynamic data features
- Planning: Database selection should be made before first data-driven feature is built
- Options: PostgreSQL (Vercel Postgres), MongoDB, Supabase, Firebase

**No API Layer:**
- Current state: No API endpoints or backend logic
- Blocks: Client-server communication, external integrations
- Scaling path: Add `app/api/` routes following Next.js API route conventions once needed

## Dependencies at Risk

**Type Definition Gaps:**
- Package: `@types/node@^20`, `@types/react@^19`, `@types/react-dom@^19`
- Risk: Wide version ranges (`^`) may introduce breaking changes on minor version bumps
- Recommendation: Consider caret vs. tilde constraints; lock critical packages in production
- Current state: `package-lock.json` provides consistency, but consider audit frequency

**Recent Major Versions:**
- Packages: React 19.2.3, Next.js 16.1.6
- Risk: These are recent major versions; stable API still being established
- Impact: May encounter upstream bugs or breaking changes more frequently
- Recommendation: Monitor release notes; test upgrades thoroughly in non-critical branches

**ESLint Major Version:**
- Package: `eslint@^9`
- Risk: ESLint 9 is a major version with flat config changes; ecosystem still adapting
- Current state: Configured with flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`)
- Recommendation: Ensure all plugins support flat config format before adding

## Documentation Gaps

**No Architecture Decision Records:**
- Problem: No ADRs or decision log for architectural choices
- Impact: Future developers won't understand why patterns were chosen
- Recommendation: Start ADR log for significant decisions (e.g., auth strategy, DB choice)

**No API Contract Documentation:**
- Problem: Not applicable yet, but will be needed when API routes are added
- Recommendation: Plan for API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger) before implementation

**No Contributing Guidelines:**
- Problem: No `CONTRIBUTING.md` or development workflow documentation
- Impact: Outside contributors or team members unclear on process
- Recommendation: Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` covering:
  - Branch naming conventions
  - Commit message format
  - Code review process
  - Testing requirements
